            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <!-- PDF PAGE 10 -->Our former Anſwers and Declarations, and of whom onely We would be underſtood to ſpeak, think ſuch Declarations and Votes to be ſuch unreſiſtable Engines of Battery againſt Us and the Law, that no ſtrength can oppoſe them: And therefore though they will take notice from whence that Letter came, they will vouchſafe it no other mention, but <hi>of a Paper</hi> (as if found by chance) inſcribed, <hi>To Our truſty and welbeloved, &amp;c.</hi> And it is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that ſince they have uſurped the Supream Power to themſelves, they have not taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them the Supream Style too, and directed this very new Declaration, <hi>To their truſty and welbeloved, their Subjects of the Citie of London;</hi> For it is too great and palpable a ſcorn to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to take up Arms againſt Our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, under colour of being loving Subjects to Our Office, and to Deſtroy Us, that they may Preſerve the King.</p>
            <p>They are offended that We ſhould beleeve, That their end of perſwading Our Subjects to raiſe Horſe, and to furniſh Money upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a Guard for the Parliament, is in truth to imploy thoſe Horſe, Men and Money a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Us: Let the reaſons of Our belief be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

            </p>
            <p>As they have Declared (the beſt Argument or Evidence you are to look for) that all that they do is lawfull, becauſe they do it; ſo they proceed, by the ſame power, to aſſure thoſe, who are apt to be deceived by them, that the Force already attending Us (they would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly do otherwiſe if they did really beleeve ſuch Force to be about Us) and the Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion We are making, do evidently appear to be intended for ſome great and extraordinary Deſigne, and do juſtifie their former Votes of Our intention of Leavying Warre againſt Our Parliament: And they have at laſt given ſome Reaſon for that Vote and Declaration; They finde by our ſeverall Declarations that We intend force againſt thoſe who ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Ordinance of the <hi>Militia,</hi> and that We intend to make an attempt upon <hi>Hull:</hi> In both which Caſes they are pleaſed to declare, <hi>That whatſoever violence ſhall be uſed either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe who exerciſe this</hi> Militia, <hi>or againſt</hi>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103804:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 12 -->to their Own houſes, and guarding it there with Armed men; whither it will be next re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved &amp; how uſed by ſuch perſons We know not. That the keeping Us out of <hi>Hull</hi> by Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham</hi> was an Act of high Treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Us, and the taking away Our Magazine and Munition from Us was an Act of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence upon Us (by what hands or by whoſe direction ſoever it was done) and in both Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, by the help of God and the Law, We will have Juſtice or loſe Our life in the requiring it, the which We do not value at that rate as to preſerve it with the infamy of ſuffering Our Self to be rob'd and ſpoiled of that dignity We were borne to. And if it be poſſible for Our good Subjects to beleeve, that ſuch a defence of Our Self, with the utmoſt power &amp; ſtrength We can raiſe, <hi>is making a War againſt the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> We do not doubt (however it ſhall pleaſe God to diſpoſe of Us in that Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) but the Iuſtice of Our Cauſe will at the laſt prevail againſt thoſe few Malignant Spirits who for their own ends and Ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes have ſo miſled and corrupted the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings of Our People, and that both Our houſes of Parliament will in ſhort time diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne

            <p>And ſince neither Our Declaration, nor the Teſtimony of ſo many of Our Lords now with Us can procure credit with theſe Men, but that they proceed to leavy Horſe, &amp; to raiſe Money and Arms againſt Us; We are not to be blamed, if (after ſo many gracious expoſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with them upon undeniable Principles of Law and Reaſon, which they anſwer one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by voting that which We ſay to be neither Law nor Reaſon, and ſo proceed actually to leavie War upon Us to juſtifie that which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be otherwiſe defended) at laſt We make ſuch Proviſion, that as We have been dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from <hi>London,</hi> and kept from <hi>Hull,</hi> We may not be ſurprized at <hi>York;</hi> but in a condition to reſiſt &amp; bring to juſtice thoſe Men, who would perſwade Our People, that their Religion is in danger, becauſe We will not conſent it ſhall be in their power to alter it by their Votes; or their Liberty in danger, becauſe We will allow no Iudge of that Liberty but the known Law of the Land: yet what ever Proviſion We ſhall be

If this be not ſummitted to, We ſhall with as good a Conſcience (and We beleeve We ſhall not want the affections of Our good Subjects to that end) proceed againſt thoſe who ſhall preſume to exerciſe that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Ordinance for the <hi>Militia,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who keep Our Town of <hi>Hull</hi> from Us, as We would reſiſt perſons who came to take away Our life or Our Crown from Us. And therefore We ſhall again remember and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Our Citie of <hi>London</hi> to obey Our former Commands, and not to be miſled by the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of thoſe Men (who are made deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate by their Fortunes, or their Fortunes by them) who tell them their Religion, Libertie, and Propertie is to be preſerved no other way but by their diſloyaltie to Us; That they are now at the brink of the river, and may draw
